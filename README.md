# Lains portfolio with GitHub pages

I wanted to make one of those really cool 3D scrolling webpages I keep seeing so I just dove right into it! This project uses ThreeJS to create an animated scene in the background of the page. I got the scene from a video game you may have played before ;) However, I retextured everything using style transfer A.I.

Feel free to poke around in the code and see how it works, you can even reuse this project for your own portfolio, just add in your own GLTF scene for customization.

Happy coding!
