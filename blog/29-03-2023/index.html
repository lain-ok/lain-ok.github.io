    <h2>Speculations on future ERP software solutions</h2>
    <h3>Here are my top insights into where ERP will be heading in the near future</p>
    <h4>Cloud computing</h4>
    <p class="insights">
        ERP software has always had the centrallized database at the core of its implementations. But what happens if your datacenter is destroyed? <br> Many large tech orginizations worked on solving these problems through the 2010s resulting in enterprise products like Google Cloud Platform, Amazon EC2 Instances, Microsoft Azure Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.<br> Procucts like these not only to make sure database information can't be lost from a single location, but significantly increase server load times on a global operations scale.<br> New technology wireless technologies like 5G are paving the way for armies of IOT sensors and also creating new ways for people to work remotly. ERP systems and remote computing should become accesible from a web browser instance  whether its on your phone, tablet, low spec computer, or full workstation. Maybe we will also see some real use cases for blockchain (its a distrubuted database at its core) in creating more of a transperant ecosystem between orginizations. With akash cloud I believe we will also be seeing the democratization of computer resources and the cost of "renting/borrowing" things like storage and computational power will lessen the financial barriers for orginizations in need of highly computational solutions (Machine learning solutions etc)
    </p>
    <h4>Accoutability</h4>
    <p class="insights">
        Its becoming increasingly more important to be aware of the impact of our actions. Next gen ERP software will account for environmental and social impact of products and services. One example of this would be acounting for the sum of your orginizatoins carbon footprint through all its business procceses in addition to waste management. Another example could relate to anti corruption practices and orginization data transperancy.
    </p>
    <h4>Digital Twins</h4>
    <p class="insights">
        IMO this is going to be one of the coolest most hyped up new feature comming to ERP (Might have something to do with my video game addiction I had when I was younger) There are a lot of software companies talking about digital twin technology but I think we are still at the point of high expectations and have not gone through the motions to realizing the practical aspects of this technology. At its core this technology is about having realtime representations of systems informed by gathering data from a vast array of sensors (often explored as some kind of 3D visualization)
